# Travel-Goals

-The aim of this project or website is to discover and be familiare with the terms: positionning, flexbox, and Grid styling in CSS also to practice 
what I already learned in HTML and CSS, so that's why I created a web page about traveling locations and which contains three links.
and a navigation bar at the top with some of the world's most famous cities, each with a brief description, as well as a link to Wikipedia
to learn more.
and a lot more...
